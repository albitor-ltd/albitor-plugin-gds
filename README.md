# GDS standards plugin (`gds`)

A [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) that helps you build and audit **GOV.UK-compliant** services. It packages the **GOV.UK Design System** and **WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility** (plus the UK public sector accessibility regulations) into skills, commands, an audit agent, and an advisory hook.

It is one of the plugins Albitor makes available to its users. The standards content is distilled from the live GOV.UK and W3C sources and bundled so the assistant has authoritative reference material to hand (see [Licensing](#licensing)).

## What's inside

### Skills (load automatically when relevant)

| Skill | Triggers on | Bundled references |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gds:govuk-design-system` | Building/reviewing a GOV.UK or public-sector frontend | All 34 components, page & "ask users for information" patterns, colour/typography/layout/spacing styles, and how to consume GOV.UK Frontend |
| `gds:govuk-accessibility` | Building/testing/advising on accessibility | All 50 WCAG 2.2 A/AA criteria, the PSBAR 2018 regulations, the accessibility-statement template, and how to test |

### Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/gds:component [name or need]` | Look up or scaffold a Design System component — macro **and** plain HTML, with accessibility notes. |
| `/gds:audit [target]` | WCAG 2.2 AA audit of a file, component, or the current changes; prioritised findings. |
| `/gds:accessibility-statement [details]` | Draft a GOV.UK-format accessibility statement from the model template. |
| `/gds:review [target]` | Review frontend changes against **both** the Design System and WCAG 2.2 AA. |

### Agent

- `accessibility-auditor` — a read-heavy subagent for a thorough WCAG 2.2 AA + Design System audit without polluting the main context. Used by `/gds:audit`, or invoke directly.

### Hook

- A non-blocking `PostToolUse` hook (`hooks/check-frontend.sh`) that runs after edits to frontend files (`.html`, `.njk`, `.svelte`, `.vue`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, and more). It flags a **high-confidence** subset of issues — missing `alt`, missing `lang`, positive `tabindex`, click handlers on `<div>`/`<span>`, fake `href="#"` buttons — and surfaces them to Claude to fix. It never blocks and stays silent on clean files. It is a nudge, not a substitute for `/gds:audit`. Requires `jq`.

## Installing

Add the marketplace that lists this plugin, then install:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add albitor-ltd/albitor-plugins
claude plugin install gds@albitor-plugins
```

Or load it directly for one session during development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/albitor-plugin-gds
```

Validate the plugin structure:

```bash
claude plugin validate /path/to/albitor-plugin-gds
```

## Keeping it current

The bundled references are a distilled snapshot, not a live mirror. GOV.UK Frontend and the Design System change (the 2025 GOV.UK brand refresh, for example, changed several functional colour values), so the skills always tell the assistant to confirm exact, current detail against the live sources:

- GOV.UK Design System — <https://design-system.service.gov.uk/>
- GOV.UK Frontend — <https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/>
- WCAG 2.2 — <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/>
- Accessibility regulations — <https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps>

To refresh the references, re-distil from those sources into `skills/*/references/` and bump the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
